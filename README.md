 2. On form submission, collect the user input and post the form data to the provided PHP script “addNewCustomer.php”
 3. Invalid input should cause the form submission to halt and alert the user to any problematic input. Please use both client- and server-side validation.
 4. If all validation checks have passed, generate a PDF document for the new customer using the FPDF Library populated with the form data. Besides the information entered by the user, the PDF document should also contain: 
     * Date and Time of form submission
     * A unique account number assigned to the new customer<br/>
* The PDF documents layout can be structured in any way you wish. Please see examples of FPDF class usage in the examples/pdf folder.<br/>
